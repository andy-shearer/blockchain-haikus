## Blockchain Haiku

### What?
This project is a collaborative writing application where multiple people can write a haiku
by suggesting and voting on the next line to be appended to the haiku.

After a line is suggested, there will be a countdown which allows alternative line suggestions, and
a voting period to take place. Once the countdown ends and voting has finished, the line is appended to 
the haiku and the next line suggestion can take place.

When the haiku is complete, it is verified to ensure it matches the pattern of a haiku, and then will
be available to mint as an NFT.

### Why?
The purpose of this project is to practice the creation of smart contracts written in Solidity, in
a more abstract and creative use-case than the previous projects I've created.

Creating a project like this which utilises smart contracts in a slightly more unique way than
most current use-cases for smart contracts will undoubtedly reveal some new challenges to solve,
making this project a good way to improve my abilities in creating robust and efficient contracts.
